These are here for replication if needed, note that path lengths would need to be changed, etc.
Gives the overview of what I did to make and analyze the data. 

Most important notebook is the following: 

## performance_evaluate_fullstats.ipynb
Includes:
* Evaluating the predictions of the model
* Model training history
* Defining the decision boundary either by crossing-point or by max-FOM method (crossing-point was decided upon in HE group)
* Evaluating such flavor classification method according to efficiency, purity, etc, as a function of variables of interest in truth data
